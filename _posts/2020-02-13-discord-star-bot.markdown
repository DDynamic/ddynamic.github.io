Discord Stars is a fun discord bot that enables you to reward your server members. It adds commands to view, add, and track complements that you can write for your server members. This bot is an excellent way to encourage your server members. They will be able to view their stars at any time.

I used Discord.js to code the bot and Postgres to store stars. I have licensed Discord Stars under the MIT license. You are free to create your instance to use on your server. You can run Discord Stars on any machine capable of running Node.js. Alternatively, you may use the Deploy to Heroku feature to get started instantly.
