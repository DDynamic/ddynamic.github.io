Grit, humility, authenticity, and integrity - organizations ripe with individuals who embody those attributes are bound to succeed. I am constantly looking to meet new people that share those values.

I fell in love with technology when I started playing the open-world sandbox game Minecraft at eight years old. Possessing some entrepreneurial spirit, I desired to monetize the game by selling in-game items on my public multiplayer server. I learned web development to build a storefront and Java to interface with the game. That project was a success, but I desired more. Two years later, I was frustrated with how difficult and expensive it was for players to make servers to play with their friends. I created a business renting wholesale, bare-metal servers - partitioning them and shipping with custom software to easily create multiplayer worlds.

After that endeavor, I took a break from programming to focus on school and some other hobbies. During the 2016 US Presidential Election, I became fascinated by civic affairs and administration. This fascination led me to pursue a summer internship at the county government center performing office duties. I saw that I could automate many voter registration processes, so I jumped quickly back into code.

My next role was at EquipmentShare, a venture-backed construction technology company. I developed financial systems, working with many engineering and back-office teams. Towards the end of my tenure, I was in a senior-level role, leading the internship program. Wanting to experience working for a smaller company, I recently joined Paytient, helping to build an employer-sponsored payment platform for employees' medical expenses.
